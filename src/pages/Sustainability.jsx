          <p>
            Our environmental strategy focuses on reducing the carbon footprint
            of logistics operations through smarter network design, route
            optimization, and digital transformation. We invest in fuel-
            efficiency initiatives, reduce idle time across fleets, and adopt
            technology that enables real-time monitoring and optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            By replacing manual processes with digital systems, we significantly
            reduce paper usage while improving accuracy, transparency, and
            operational speed. Environmental performance is reviewed regularly
            to ensure continuous improvement and accountability.
